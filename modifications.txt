 ABSTRACT
Problems:

Lacks numeric results

Unclear novelty

Fix: Rewrite with 4 clear parts:

Problem (1‚Äì2 lines)

Proposed solution (1‚Äì2 lines)

Simulation/results summary (2‚Äì3 lines, with numbers!)

Novelty points (last line)

‚úÖ Also add 4‚Äì6 keywords at the end of abstract.


 INTRODUCTION
Strengths: Good background, strong motivation
Fixes Needed:

Avoid repetition from abstract.

Add clear objective at the end: e.g.,

"This paper proposes a control strategy for a single-stage solar PV system with battery storage that ensures continuous MPPT operation during LVRT conditions under unbalanced faults, validated by simulation."

Add a bullet list of main contributions:

Novel current reference generation for balanced injection under unbalanced faults

Battery energy storage ensures MPPT under grid faults

Overcurrent protection and voltage regulation via BDDC

Dual MPPT comparison (PSO vs. INC)

Validation under realistic dynamic load

 LITERATURE REVIEW (integrated into Introduction)
Problems:

Too many unrelated citations

No comparison summary

Fixes:

Make a table comparing your work with 5‚Äì6 recent works
(columns: Ref, Topology, LVRT method, MPPT support, Battery used, Real-time test)

Clearly state how your work improves on each prior work

SYSTEM MODEL & DESIGN
Strengths: Decent explanations
Fixes:

Add a clear list of system parameters (PV size, battery specs, filter L/C values)

Use proper symbols and avoid formula clutter

Clarify the PV sizing logic (6.6 kW ‚Äì why?)

Use IEEE format for equations: number all equations, define symbols right after equations.

‚úÖ Keep: Fig. 3, battery-PV control idea.

 CONTROL STRATEGY
Fixes:

Break into 4 separate subsections:

A. MPPT Control (PSO & INC)

B. LVRT Reference Current Generation

C. Overcurrent Limiting

D. Grid Synchronization / Reactive Injection

Add flowchart or algorithm diagram for control loop.

Emphasize how battery and control maintain MPPT during sag.

‚úÖ Keep: active/reactive formulas, reactive current logic.

 SIMULATION & RESULTS
Problems:

No quantitative comparison

PSO/INC not analyzed in depth

No explanation for Fig. numbers

Fixes:

Clearly label each figure (PSO, INC, grid currents, DC-link voltage, battery current, PV power, etc.)

Add a results table comparing PSO vs INC vs traditional MPPT:

MPPT efficiency (%)

Settling time (s)

THD (%)

Overcurrent protection triggered (yes/no)

Explain what each plot proves

Simulate at least:

Balanced fault

Unbalanced fault (e.g., LG or LLG)

Voltage sag/swell

Load variation

CONCLUSION
Fixes:

Add 3 short paragraphs:

Recap of what was proposed

Key results achieved (numbers!)

Why it's better than others

FUTURE SCOPE
Add Specificity:

Mention AI/ML control (you already started this)

Suggest:

Using DRL for real-time MPPT

Coordinated multi-inverter LVRT

Smart grid forecasting + MPPT

 REFERENCES
Problems:

Old (many before 2015)

Inconsistent format

No recent IEEE papers on LVRT+MPPT

Fixes:

Add at least 3‚Äì5 papers from 2022‚Äì2025

Use Google Scholar or IEEE Xplore

Look for papers with single-stage, LVRT, PSO/AI control

Reformat all in IEEE or Elsevier style
